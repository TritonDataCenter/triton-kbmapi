## Development

This is an incomplete work in progress of a proof of concept.  You have
been warned.

    make all (Someday)


## Test

This probably still fails miserably, but soon...

    make test


## Documentation

Docs would be nice...

To update the guidelines, edit "docs/index.md" and run `make docs`
to update "docs/index.html". Works on either SmartOS or Mac OS X.
